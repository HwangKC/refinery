Most of this code is public-domain: you may do anything you wish with it
without crediting anybody. (If you do decide to point end-users to
http://github.com/adamh/refinery, you may benefit if they report bugs.)

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE

Some of this code isn't public-domain.

Anything in a "licensed/gpl" subdirectory is GPL code. It can be enabled by
running "cmake -D LICENSE_GPL=ON ." and it will taint your binaries and
shared libraries: they'll be GPL as well. Read the entire GPL license at:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

This includes:

* include/licensed/gpl
* src/licensed/gpl
* test/licensed/gpl (yes, those tests are licensed, too)
* util/licensed/gpl

The motivation: Exiv2 is a great library for reading Exif data but it's
licensed under the GPL.

Should you decide to compile the GPL code or use GPL binaries, your license
is included in the COPYING-GPL file, and the headers of the GPLed files name
the authors.
