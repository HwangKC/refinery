EXAMPLE
=======

Read util/raw2ppm.cc: it reads a raw file and outputs a PPM image.

util/licensed/gpl/raw2ppm.py does the same thing in Python


COMPILING
=========
This project's Makefile is generated by CMake.

To regenerate the Makefile, run "cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .".

To make a debug-suited Makefile, use "Debug" instead of "Release".

Finally, "make" and (if installing) "sudo make install".

Then, to convert images, use "raw2ppm RAWFILE PPM".

Better yet, explore the API and fit refinery into your own project.
